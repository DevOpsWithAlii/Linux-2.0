## 🔧 PART 2: Advanced Linux Commands & Bash Scripting

---

### 🔍 1. Search & Filter Tools

#### a. `grep` – Global Regular Expression Print

Searches through file contents.

```bash
$ grep "error" logfile.txt
```

#### b. `awk` – Pattern scanning and processing

Extracts and processes text.

```bash
$ awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

#### c. `sed` – Stream editor

Used to find and replace text.

```bash
$ sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
```

#### d. `cut` – Cuts sections of each line

```bash
$ cut -d ':' -f1 /etc/passwd
```

#### e. `find` – Find files by name, type, size, etc.

```bash
$ find /home -name "*.txt"
```

#### f. `locate` – Searches faster using a pre-built index

```bash
$ locate notes.txt
```

---

### 🔗 2. Pipes, Redirection, and Chaining

#### a. Redirect output to a file

```bash
$ echo "Hello" > hello.txt
```

#### b. Append output

```bash
$ echo "World" >> hello.txt
```

#### c. Chain commands

```bash
$ mkdir test && cd test
```

#### d. Use pipe `|` to link commands

```bash
$ cat file.txt | grep "error"
```

#### e. `tee` – Show output AND write to file

```bash
$ ls -l | tee list.txt
```

---

### 📜 3. Bash Scripting Basics

#### a. Your first script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```

Save as `hello.sh`, then run:

```bash
$ chmod +x hello.sh
$ ./hello.sh
```

#### b. Variables

```bash
name="Ali"
echo "Hello $name"
```

#### c. Conditions

```bash
if [ -f "file.txt" ]; then
  echo "File exists"
fi
```

#### d. Loops

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
  echo "Number $i"
done
```

#### e. Arguments

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "First arg: $1"
```

---

### 🔄 4. Useful Script Examples

#### a. Backup script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czvf backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz /home/user
```

#### b. User check script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if id "$1" &>/dev/null; then
  echo "User exists."
else
  echo "User not found."
fi
```

#### c. Service monitor script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
if systemctl is-active apache2; then
  echo "Apache is running."
else
  echo "Restarting Apache..."
  systemctl restart apache2
fi
```

## 🧪 PART 4: Interview Questions, Labs & Projects

---

### ❓ 1. Linux Interview Questions (with examples)

#### Q1. How do you find large files in a directory?

```bash
$ find / -type f -size +100M
```

#### Q2. How do you schedule a job?

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

Add:

```bash
0 5 * * * /home/user/backup.sh
```

#### Q3. Difference between `hard link` and `soft link`?

* Hard Link: Points directly to the file inode.
* Soft Link: A shortcut (like in Windows).

#### Q4. How do you check disk usage?

```bash
$ df -h
$ du -sh *
```

#### Q5. How do you monitor memory?

```bash
$ free -m
```

---

### 🔬 2. Real-Life Practice Labs

#### Lab 1: Create a user and give them sudo access

```bash
$ adduser devuser
$ usermod -aG sudo devuser
```

#### Lab 2: Write a script to archive logs

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf logs_$(date +%F).tar.gz /var/log/*.log
```

#### Lab 3: Setup a cron job to clear temp folder daily

```bash
$ crontab -e
```

```bash
0 2 * * * rm -rf /tmp/*
```

---

### 🧩 3. Mini Projects

#### Project 1: Disk Usage Alert Script

Sends alert email if disk > 80%

#### Project 2: Health Check Script

* Checks CPU, memory, disk
* Logs report to a file
* Sends warning if thresholds exceed

#### Project 3: Automated Backup System

* Compresses files
* Stores by date
* Runs daily with cron

---

### 🧠 Final Takeaways

* Practice by building things
* Break things. Fix them.
* Read logs. Explore man pages.
* Interview prep = daily command use + scripting

> **Quote:** "Linux is not just an OS. It's a toolset. Learn to wield it."
